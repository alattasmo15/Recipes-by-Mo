# Recipes-by-Mo
Developed a recipe sharing platform where users can easily register, log in, browse recipes by category, post their own recipes, comment on others, and edit their profiles. I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface with a strong backend to manage user data and recipes smoothly.

Features Include:
- User authentication (secure login/registration)
- Search functionality (search recipes by name or ingredient)
- Commenting system for interaction
- Profile editing
- Recipe images upload
